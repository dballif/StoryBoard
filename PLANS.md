# Project Plans

## Basics
Part of the point of this project is to become more familiar with a few technologies and so I will
be using them for large portions.

Front End - React
Back End - Python

Long Term - I want to find a way to use a solidity smart contract. Maybe create ownership on the
blockchain, so the Storyboard could be traded.
